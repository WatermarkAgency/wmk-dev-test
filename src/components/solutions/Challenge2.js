 * here: https://www.figma.com/file/8hAFoMRUo9lLmBeDko0UVr/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1
 * Each card should link to the attachmentUrl in a new window.
 * (BONUS 1) - Make the image have a 10% zoom effect and darken the
 * drop shadow when the card is hovered.
 * (BONUS 2) - Also on hover: have the Outlet Name animate out to the left.
 * The Contact Name should slide in from the right in its place.
 * (BONUS 3) - When the cards are on the mobile breakpoint, hide the article
 * text and the graphic element, so that the cards are shorter in height.
